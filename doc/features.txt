*Features* used in the library
------------------------------

:budden - add this if you're budden
:building-see-packages - installed temporarily when
the library is being build to localize changes I have
made to third-party libraries I've included in :buddens-tools
library. 
:ORG.TFEB.HAX.HIERARCHICAL-PACKAGES,:ORG.TFEB.HAX.RELATIVE-PACKAGE-NAMES
- are present as we have hierarchical packages loaded.
:russian - if this feature is set, there are functions, e.g.,
string-upcase-cyr to work with Russian character case. 
also, there are comment string in Russian which can cause reader error
on some systems. So, set this feature if you're Russian :)
