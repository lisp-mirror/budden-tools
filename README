This is an implementation of portable common lisp reader. 
See "packages revisited" topic at comp.lang.lisp
and *test* files. 

1. Put asd systems and shortcuts as usual.
2. Download dependencies. 
Iterate-keywords can be downloaded from 
sourceForge, the rest can be taken from
well known repos (I recommend using clbuild)
3. Look at load.lisp

Tested under lispworks and allegro for windows,
CLISP, ccl and sbcl under 32-bit debian etch.

This code is a complete mess, it has to be 
cleaned, de-localized and documented. 

Defstruct staff does not work at all.
