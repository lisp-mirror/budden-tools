  "Merge packages and reexport their exports. Package dest will re-export all non-clashing external symbols 
of source-packages. If use-first-duplicate is t, it also reexport first of any set of clashing symbols, by order 
of source-packages. Warns on clashing symbols unless their keywordized symbol-names are put on dont-warn-on list. Additionally, just uses listed packages, but do not try to avoid clashes. If some symbols from used packages are clashing between themselves, or there are clashes between used-packages and source-packages, execution would fail. :use is intended mostly for using cl package. 
Example: (merge-packages-and-reexport :iterate+cl-utilities (:iterate :cl-utilites)

If you want to specify some custom exports, it is good idea to make an intermediate package
with merge then use it in your package and then reexport from intermidiate package. E.g., if in 
\(defpackage :p1 (:use :cl) (:export :sym :s1 :nth))
\(defpackage :p2 (:use :cl) (:export :sym :s2 :nth))
you want new package with p1:s1 
\(with-compilation-unit () (merge-packages-and-reexport:! :intermediate (:p1 :p2) :dont-warn-on (:sym))
  (defpackage :p1+p2-with-sym-from-p1

   (:export :sym))
