;;; This code is based on that found at

;;; The following source code is in the public domain.
;;; Provided "as is" with no warranty of any kind.  
;;; Use at your own risk.
;;;
;;; Despite the header above, I, Tim Bradshaw, am not the author of this
;;; code, I just changed it a bit.
;;;
;;; Notes by Budden
;;; this code relies on begin able to process ".relative-name" package name. 
;;; I've added read hooks which work at the time of finding symbol, this is done
;;; by assigning macro-character to any character from which symbol name can start.
;;; But I was unable to assign macro-character to #\. in a portable way due to
;;; non-conformance in SBCL reader. So hierarchical packages stuff will not work
;;; in any implementation where (read) does not call (symbol-function 'find-package),
;;; e.g. CLISP
;;; Notes for ccl - we need to replace ccl::%find-pkg
